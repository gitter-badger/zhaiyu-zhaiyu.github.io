<p>That was a month ago, I find <a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Telegram</a> is a good new tool to communicate with my friends.  The encryption and privacy things are all satisfying me.  </p>
<p><u>I signed up…I had an account…<strong>I had no contact in it</strong></u></p>
<p>I know, it’s always a problem that none of your friend join in.  For me, it’s a problem.</p>
<p>At least, the same problem came up when I am ready to use <a href="https://www.path.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Path</a>.</p>
<p>We are not leader in a little group, even we are, we would not use the tiny power to force our friends to use a new tool.  What we do is listing the advantages of the new tool and persuade friends into using it.  Fail a lot?  Aye, that’s true.</p>
<p>But here are some reasons for you to use new communicating tool or network:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason why you are willing to use the new thing.</li>
<li>The same habit and attitude towards innovation shared between you and your friend.</li>
<li>The fact that a true loving friend would try your suggestion and even there is only one contact in his/her list, which is you, he/she would keep the app in the phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would call the 3 lines above <strong>Y.’s Standard of Friendship</strong>.</p>
<p>So I have few friends.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="hacked-01.png" alt="screen shot of the game"></p>
<p>2 days ago, I found a game on the Android OS called <a href="http://www.hackedapp.com" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>hacked</strong></a>.  I find it highly entertaining so I’d like to intro it to you.</p>
<p><strong>hacked</strong> is so-called <em>world’s first mobile coding game</em>, and it is in BETA period.  So it seems that we cannot install it from Google Play Store.  I down it from a 3rd-party store.  I am not sure if it’s ok to do that obeying the rules.  Anyway, here some info for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hacked</strong> uses a simple and powerful language to code, whose name is <strong>H</strong>.  It’s simple for the <a href="http://www.hackedapp.com/documentation.html" target="_blank" rel="external">documentation</a> is so short.  But there have been a lot of little game coded in H language.  </li>
<li><strong>hacked</strong> has a UI which take advantage of the touchscreen.  <s>Although I did not use it properly before I watched its video,</s> it is designed for phone on purpose.  Instead of letting user type the names of vars in, <strong>hacked</strong> is designed to use a flexible keyboard which changes with the position of cursor with var-name key like <code>var_a</code> or <code>f1</code>.  It’s not a good way to name you varibles but on phone it’s good enough.</li>
<li>The <strong>story</strong> mode contains a heroic story, about FBI things.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may think that ‘I am not a coder, why this game?’. Maybe you are right.  But, it’s a game!  Is is not enough for you to play it?  You play sudoku, you play puzzles, you play Rubik Cubes, here is a new option for you intelligent guys.  Just try it.  And I think it’s a better choice for those who want to learn programming but are non-professional programmer to kick start.</p>
