<h2><a href="nmc/README.html">NO MORE CLUELESS</a></h2>
<p>This was a set of essays in Chinese which was aimed to tell the new computer users the basic knowledges of the machine in front of them, used to be a repo on github.  I thought maybe some others can join and write some.  HOWEVER, only one friend starred it and no one commit or fork.  I think it is time to cancel that repo but it is kind of my &quot;hardwork&quot;.  So now it is in my blog.  Of cource, it is in Chinese.</p>
<h2>ABOUT CHEMISTRY</h2>
<p>I am studying Chemistry in Jilin University, China.  Some homework can be published here, I think. That does not value too much.  But if freshmen in JLU want to take them as a sample, I am OK with that.  Remember, do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> just simply copy them because I push them here for communicating and studying, <strong><em>NOT FOR CHEATING</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>ABOUT THEORETICAL &amp; COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY</h2>
<p>I am a freshman in this field, too.  It should be my notes about the knowledges I learnt recently.</p>
<h2>MY PREFERENCE FOR SOME SOFTWARES</h2>
<p>I am a fan of Vim, LaTeX, <i>etc.</i></p>
