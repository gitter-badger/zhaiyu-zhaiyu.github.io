## NO MORE CLUELESS
This was a set of essays in Chinese which was aimed to tell the new computer users the basic knowledges of the machine in front of them, used to be a repo on github.  I thought maybe some others can join and write some.  HOWEVER, only one friend starred it and no one commit or fork.  I think it is time to cancel that repo but it is kind of my "hardwork".  So now it is in my blog.

## ABOUT CHEMISTRY
I am studying Chemistry in Jilin University, China.  Some homework can be published here, I think. That does not value too much.  But if freshmen in JLU want to take them as a sample, I am OK with that.  Remember, do ***NOT*** just simply copy thme because I push them here for communicating and studying, ***NOT FOR CHEATING***.

## ABOUT THEORETICAL & COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY
I am a freshman in this field, too.  It should be my notes about the knowledges I learnt recently.
